## Description & Features

Explore the features offered by the application with our [web user interface](http://singf.space/pixiv/controls).

This application runs on Windows that sets the **best** suited illustration from [Pixiv Daily Rankings](https://www.pixiv.net/ranking.php?mode=daily&content=illust) as your wallpaper based on your screen resolution and a smart image selection algorithm.

All you need is a double click, and your wallpaper is set in seconds! If you don't like it, you also have the choice to choose your own wallpaper from Pixiv high ranking illustrations, also with just a few clicks!

The application also has [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) built-in so you'll get a high-resolution image even if the creator only uploaded a low resolution illustration.
