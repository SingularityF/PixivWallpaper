  <h3>Why are there illustrations I can't pick from even though they're in the Pixiv daily ranking?</h3>
  <div>We only deliver illustrations that did not show up in the previous day's daily ranking so that users won't
    receive the same wallpaper two days in a row. Additionally, we only collect the top 50 illustrations, so the
    actual number of illustrations you can pick from is always less than 50. But illustrations that showed up in the
    previous day's daily ranking may still be available for today if they ranked more than 50 yesterday but less
    than 50 today.</div>
  <h3 class="mt-5">Why is the illustration I got in low resolution? Shouldn't it be in its original resolution?</h3>
  <div>The creator of this illustration only uploaded a low-res version to Pixiv, therefore we cannot obtain a version
    with a higher resolution and the version you got is already "original". Please log into Pixiv and enlarge the
    illustration to confirm this.</div>
